    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>
      My current work focuses on understanding the physical properties of lava, specifically the viscosity of basalts. I use a combined approach of in-situ field techniques and high-temperature laboratory techniques to study how the lava viscosity changes with temperature, crystallinity, vesicularity, and oxygen fugacity.

      Additionally, I still have a keen interest in all things related to physical and petrochemical volcanology. Specifically, I am fascinated by magma-ice interactions and the landforms they produce. I have been involved in studies that use the presence (and absence) of glaciovolcanic landforms to reconstruct localized paleoenviroments. I firmly believe this is an underutilized tool in the recovery of past cycles of glaciation.

      Lastly, I have an interest in shallow magmatic plumbing systems within the crust. I have been involved in petrochemical studies that elucidate monogenetic magma chamber dynamics, storage, and I continue to find the usage of geochemical data conjoined to field observations a fascinating way to gain insight into the magma-crustal dynamics of the Earth.

      <li>
        <strong>The Rheological and Textural Evolution of Moana Loa Lava, Insights from 2022 Eruption:</strong>  
        This study employs conventional remelt rheology for the lavas erupted near the summit of Mauna Loa in 2022. Conditions of supra-liquidus and sub-liquidus (at thermal disequilibrium and equilibrium) are simulated to recover the viscosity changes across temperature and crystallization space.

        <strong>The Multiphase Rheology of Natural Lava: Insights from Litli-Hrútur, Iceland:</strong>  
        The study is the first to combine in-situ field viscometry with comprehensive laboratory remelt rheology. This combined approach gives insight into the true natural eruptive evolution of viscosity (as highlighted in

    <h3>Past Projects</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Glaciovolcanism within the Mount Meager Volcanic Complex of SW British Columbia:</strong> This study employs conventional physical volcanology to reconstruct the eruptive history of a transitional explosive and effusive tuya, Cracked Mountain, near the flank of the stratovolcano Mount Meager (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2022.107477" target="_blank">Harris et al. 2022</a>). The work on Cracked Mountain was supported by further mapping of both glaciovolcanic and non-glaciovolcanic landforms around the Mount Meager Volcanic Complex, which, when combined with a series of new geochronology ages, yielded a robust paleoenvironmental reconstruction across the last 500 ka for the localized region (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1139/cjes-2022-0101" target="_blank">Harris et al. 2023</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Polymagmatic Sources of a Monogenetic Volcano:</strong> This study employed petrochemical analyses for the monogenetic Cracked Mountain Tuya basalts, which revealed a bimodal phase assemblage of phenocrysts. Subsequent thermodynamic modeling of the two crystal assemblages revealed distinct crustal conditions requiring two separate storage conditions for the erupted lavas (<a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2022.859794" target="_blank">Harris and Russell 2022</a>).</p>
