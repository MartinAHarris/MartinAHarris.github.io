    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I earned my bachelor's degree from the University of Oregon in 2017, where I first became fascinated by volcanoes and the landscapes they produce. I went on to pursue a master's degree at the University of British Columbia, where I refined my field mapping skills in the rugged coastal mountains during the summers, focusing on the glaciovolcanic landforms surrounding the Mount Meager Volcanic Complex. I completed my master's degree in 2021 and then continued on to a PhD at the University at Buffalo, shifting my focus to the physical properties of basaltic lavas.

For my dissertation work, I learned to engineer scientific tools to collect in-situ viscosity measurements of erupting lavas. I also developed techniques to remelt volcanic rocks in the laboratory to measure their physical properties and compare them to the field-based results. I earned my PhD in 2025 and currently serve as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University at Buffalo.

My ongoing research goals include expanding the use of field viscometry to global eruptions by collaborating with other researchers working on active effusive lava systems. I aim to apply new insights on lava flow behavior to improve hazard assessments and modeling approaches for future volcanic eruptions.</p>
